# So many chinese cheaters in battlefield 5. How could I fuck them up?

This is a guide to fuck them up!

[简体中文版](./README_zh_CN.md)

Since EA is doing nothing against Battlefield cheating, and there is no way to prevent cheating legally. 

We, Battlefield 4, Battlefield 1, Battlefield 5, and Battlefield 2142 Asia players, call on all those who love Battlefield games, use all means, to declare war against the merchants. 

We are collecting personal information of cheating software sellers. We will run QQ message flooding, run SMS bombarding, run phone-call bombarding, report their social accounts, and all other legal or illegal means, to cause long-term or permanent mental damage to these merchants.

We are also attacking these countless [Taobao Cheating Software sellers](proof/taobao.png).

## Why are we fighting against game-cheating in this way

Because there is no legal way to fight against it in our country at all. 

In our nation, the behavior of selling game-cheating software is usually tried for "illegal business operations" or "sabotaging computer systems". To charge them for either of the crimes, EA must sue them. Obviously, it's impossible for EA to do it in Chinese count (just like Tencent does). 

These merchants are directly accountable for the situation that almost all Asia Battlefield gaming servers are "unplayable". Since we cannot fight against them in a clean way, we must at least try to solve the problem in a dirty way. 

## How do I help in the war

1. Register a taobao account, and spam these sellers with aggresive texts. [Guide to spam them](taobao-howto.md)
1. Report their social media account. 
1. Pretend yourself to be someone who want to buy a cheating software, and add their social media account. When they start talking to you, just do some verbal violence to waste their time. (Or do anything else to make you happy and waste their even more time, for example, calling them at midnight, ask for payment method without actually paying, spam them with automatic chat software, etc...)
1. Pay $10 to buy a phone bombarding service, and attack their phone number. 
1. Post their contact information everywhere. For example, "If you want to date a hot girl, add QQ xxxxxxxxx". 
1. Help us to get phone number from QQ/Wechat account, get any other info from existing info, etc. (You need to provide the proof, so, don't delete your screenshots~)
1. Anything that make you happy and ruin their day. 

Note that you should avoid using your real social media account or real phone number, because some of them might launch a counterattack. 

## How do I add a new enemy

You just raise a Pull Request to add an entry to the sheet. Note that it's mandatory to provide a proof, to show that this guy is selling cheating software. 

Usually, when you see someone bombing the battlefield chatting area to advertise his shits, you just take a screenshot, and add that guy to our ememy list.
